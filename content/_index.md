# __Hello, I am Shivang__

I'm doing bachelors in CS. I am exploring and low level coding and computer architecture are my current interests.

I am proficient in C and Linux (I daily drive NixOS btw), I've dabbled in web dev, and am excited to learn AI soon.

Right now, I'm getting my hands dirty with Golang and nerding out over the book 'Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective' to strengthen my understanding of what my code does under the hood.
